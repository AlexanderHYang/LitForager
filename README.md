# LitForager: Multimodal Immersive Literature Foraging and Sensemaking

LitForager is an **immersive analytics system** designed to help researchers **forage, organize, and make sense of academic literature** using **interactive 3D network visualizations** and **multimodal interactions** (gesture, voice, and menus) in **VR**.

## Features

- **Immersive 3D Literature Network:** Visualize papers—retrieved from the **Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus**—as nodes and their relationships (citations, authorship, thematic similarity, and custom links) as edges in an immersive spatial graph powered by **WebXR** and **Babylon.js**.
- **Multimodal Interaction:** Seamlessly interact with the system using hand gestures, voice commands, and WIMP-style hand menus.
- **Intelligent Recommendations:** Expand your literature network with recommendations based on thematic similarity, citation links, and author-centric exploration.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Summarize papers and extract keywords using LLMs (e.g., **Gemini 2.5 Flash**).
- **Flexible Spatial Organization:** Arrange, cluster, and link papers in 3D space to externalize your understanding and support sensemaking.
- **Speech-Based Annotation:** Dictate and attach notes to papers without breaking your exploration flow.
